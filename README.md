# A Geospecial Analysis Of Ground Water Quality Mapping Using In Nalgonda District

The methodology involves collections of water samples. The water quality database is analyzed and then used as attribute database for the preparation of thematic maps showing distribution of various water quality parameters. The thematic map of groundwater quality parameters, such as pH, TDS, EC, Carboante(CO3), Sodium(Na), Chloride(Cl) Sulphates(SO4), Nitrate(NO3), Fluoride(F), were used for overlay integration analysis to prepare the groundwater quality map of Nalgonda district using Inverse Distance Weighted(IDW) spatial interpolation technique. Finally the various water quality spatial contour maps were used in GIS for integration analysis to prepare the water quality map
